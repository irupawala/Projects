* Design & Verification of Single Cycle, 5 Stage pipelined MIPS R300 microprocessor with Data Hazard Detection, Data Forwarding, Control Hazard Detection & Branch Delay Slot in System Verilog with an IPC of 0.90.
* Developement of exhaustive test environments for DUT. Error Rate Achieved = 0.0. 
* Compilation and Synthesized of Design using Genesis2 extension of System Verilog, which allows Perl elaboration of System Verilog. 
* Extraction of Area, Power and Timing Reports.


**Languages:** System Verilog, Genesis2 (Perl Elaboration of System Verilog)

**Tools used:** Synopsys VCS, Synopsys Design Compiler
